### TODO

At any point we may want to refactor the code at our discretion

- [ ] Filter out unavailable emojis
- [ ] Improve relevance of the search
- [ ] Create a new component (EmojiIconSelector) which has a placeholder grayed out icon
  - On-click of placeholder icon, a popup opens in which we have the following features
    - A search field to search for an emoji or icon
    - A default list of icons and emojis each grouped vertically with group names ("Emojis", "Icons")
    - On searching for keywords, the list of icons and emojis filters to show only the relevant icons and emojis
    - A clear icon/button to clear the search keyword
    - A clear icon/button to clear the selected icon/emoji
  - On click of any of the emojis or icons in the list, the placeholder icon is replaced with the selected icon
- [ ] Create a way for the user to upload an image of their choice as an icon
  - The uploaded icon can be stored in localStorage. Use of `redux-sagas` is recommended.
  - An uploading indicator, error in upload indicator and successful upload status indicator can be added as features.
  - The uploaded icon can be listed at the top in the popup under the group of "uploaded icons"
  - The uploaded icon can be stored in a redux store to avoid the need to load from localstorage everytime.
- [ ] Include `redux-form` and create a `Field` component which wraps the EmojiIconSelector
- [ ] Add jest unit tests.
